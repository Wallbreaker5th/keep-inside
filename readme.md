# Keep Inside

Game for the Ludum Dare 54 Compo.

*Limited Space*, but you don't act as a player inside the space, but control the space itself.

You can manipulate the vertices of the polygon by dragging them, but the total area of the polygon will always remain constant. Your objective is to keep the ball inside the polygon.
